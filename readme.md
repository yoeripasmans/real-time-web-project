<!-- This repo will hold the project you're going to build during the last two weeks of RTW. It functions as a way to show you've attained the following learning goals of this course:

* Build a Node Web App which consumes an external data source through an API and serves a frontend using routing and templating techniques.
* Create a "live" web app which reflects changes to the back-end data model in reactive front-end views, using real-time, event-based, messaging technologies like sockets or server-sent-events.
* Describe their work in a professional readme with insightful diagrams showing the life cycle of their data. -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties 🌠 -->

<!-- Where do the 0️⃣s and 1️⃣s live in your project? What db system are you using?-->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- How about a license here? 📜 (or is it a licence?) 🤷 -->
